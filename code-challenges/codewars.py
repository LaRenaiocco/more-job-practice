# 8kyu - Pre Fizz workout
# This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.

# Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, 
# you have NO CONTROL over its value.

# Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

# Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.

# and price (per mango), calculate the total cost of the mangoes.

# pseudocode:
# input quantity of mangoes and price per mango
# output is a dollar amount for the number of mangoes purchased
# We can figure out the number of mangoes that will be bought/number free

# the result will be the number of free mangoes
# subtract result from total quanity to get number that must be purchased
